Market Basket Analysis using Apiori Algorithm for the association rule rule mining in combination with machine learning classification models such as Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier. The primary goal is to discover interesting item associations in transactions and use machine learning techniques to rank the discovered rules according to their confidence values. The approach entails pre-sorting data to obtain fre-quent item sets, deriving usable association rules, and using patterns to make these insights clearer. 
The dataset was cleared of null values, missing entries and duplicate rows as a means of improving its quality.
The Logistic Regression model achieved an overall accuracy of 78.57%, suggesting a fair ability to differentiate between high- and low-confidence rules.
The Decision Tree Classifier demonstrated superior performance, achieving a perfect accuracy of 100%.
Another prospective direction is applying real-time data streaming approaches that can support on-the-fly rule generation and evaluation. In the constantly changing today’s environment, virtual MBA, instant at Apache Kafka or Spark Streaming, can be applied to emerging ones to respond simultaneously to the customer’s behaviour. For example, real-time analysis can be used to recommend related products during the e-shopping processes to make consumers’ experiences more relevant
